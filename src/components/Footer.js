        This is a footer. IÂ´m not sure why they are so needed, but here it goes.
        Please don't steal anything. By the way, if you want to contact me do it
        at <a href="mailto:unpluggeed@gmail.com">unpluggeed@gmail.com</a>. Watch
        for the double "ee", the cool one was already taken. (Something similar
        happened on the site's url, did you notice?)
      </p>
    </footer>

export default Footer;
